# Loci-Region-Intersect
Intersecting variants associated with schizoprhenia with gene annotations to provide leads for follow up functional experiments.
# Description
This project uses computational methods to intersect regions of accessible chromatin from ATAC-seq with genetic loci to efficiently identify variants for functional follow up. Details 
on how SNPs of interests were collected are detailed [here](https://github.com/kjcgo/LDproxy-batch-query).
The starting BED files are from publicly available ATAC seq data for human neurons, iPSCs, and neural stem cells. From 311 lead SNPs, we found 100,512 total relevant SNPs. With 
this method we identified 3390 variants that fall under at least one accessible region and 1133 that exclusively intersect neural stem cell regions.
